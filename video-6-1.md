Functors
========

## Motivation
Functors are important to define Natural Transformations, which we will see in the future (9.1).

Mathematically speaking, it's a mapping between 2 categories.

In the previous chapters we referred to patterns, as structures. A pattern can be a catogory in itself. Wiht this in mind, pattern matching is the ability of recognizing a category inside another category. We will come back to this when we will discuss about limits and colimits, when we will see that products and co-products are just examples of limits and co-limits.

When mapping between categories, we will see one category as the model, and we recognize the model inside another category. This is the motivation for functors.
