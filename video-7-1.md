Functoriality, bifunctors
=========================

## Functors and Endofunctors
So we saw that

* Functors are mapping *between* categories
* Endofunctors are mapping *within* a category

The rules are just the same.

A Functor is like a number of functions put together.

* There is one major function that map objects (and this is an actual function only if the category is small, that is, only if its objects form a set)
* But it also has to preserve the structure of category, hence Functor maps the connections between objects, the morphisms: for each pair of objects we have the set of morphisms, the hom-set, and we define a mapping between hom-sets to the corresponding hom-sets in the othere category, and the mapping is a function.
